<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his post will discuss as a basic introduction to using Numpy, with my experiences as a beginner.  I've tried to include other resources and common places to get stuck.</p>

## Introduction to the NumPy world
NumPy is a powerful library that forms the foundation of much of the scientific computing ecosystem in Python. Its array-based computing model, along with its extensive collection of mathematical functions, makes it an indispensable tool for data manipulation, numerical analysis, and scientific computing tasks. This introduction provides a brief overview of NumPy's features and its importance in Python programming.


#### Getting Started with NumPy:
To use NumPy in your Python environment, you first need to install it. You can install NumPy using pip, the Python package manager, with the following command:
```
pip install numpy
```
Once installed, you can import NumPy into your Python scripts or interactive sessions using the following convention:
```
import numpy as np
```

#### Best Uses
My first experiences with Numpy came in Math 215 at BYU. I had no previous coding experience with Python so there was a little bit of a learning curve that I hope this tutorial will speed up.

My favorite resource I found when I kept getting stuck was this website: <a href="[https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html]" target="_blank">NumPy Library</a>
