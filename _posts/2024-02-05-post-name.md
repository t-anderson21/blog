<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his post will discuss as a basic introduction to using Numpy, with my experiences as a beginner.  I've tried to include other resources and common places to get stuck.</p>

## Introduction to the NumPy world
NumPy is a powerful library that forms the foundation of much of the scientific computing ecosystem in Python. Its array-based computing model, along with its extensive collection of mathematical functions, makes it an indispensable tool for data manipulation, numerical analysis, and scientific computing tasks


#### Getting Started with NumPy:
To use NumPy in your Python environment, you first need to install it. You can install NumPy using pip, the Python package manager, with the following command:

pip install numpy

Once installed, you can import NumPy into your Python scripts or interactive sessions using the following convention:

import numpy as np
