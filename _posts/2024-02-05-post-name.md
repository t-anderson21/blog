<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his post will discuss as a basic introduction to using Numpy, with my experiences as a beginner.  I've tried to include other resources and common places to get stuck.</p>

## Quick Intro to the NumPy world (for beginners!)
NumPy is a powerful library that forms the foundation of much of the scientific computing ecosystem in Python. Its array-based computing model, along with its extensive collection of mathematical functions, makes it an indispensable tool for data manipulation, numerical analysis, and scientific computing tasks. This introduction provides a brief overview of NumPy's features and its importance in Python programming.


#### Getting Started with NumPy:
To use NumPy in your Python environment, you first need to install it. You can install NumPy using pip, the Python package manager, with the following command:
```
pip install numpy
```
Once installed, you can import NumPy into your Python scripts or interactive sessions using the following convention:
```
import numpy as np
```

#### Best Uses
My first experiences with Numpy came in Math 215 at BYU. I had no previous coding experience with Python so there was a little bit of a learning curve that I hope this tutorial will speed up.

hmtml code snippets also work


My favorite resource I found when I kept getting stuck was this website: <a href="[https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html]" target="_blank">NumPy Library</a>

#### Code Snippets

```
import numpy as np

# Creating a one-dimensional array
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(array1)
```

Simple math is a great starting place...
```
# Element-wise addition
addition = a + b
print("Element-wise addition:")
print(addition)
print()

# Element-wise multiplication
multiplication = a * b
print("Element-wise multiplication:")
print(multiplication)
print()

```

## Unordered List
* List Item
* Longer List Item
  * Nested List Item
  * Nested Item
* List Item

## Ordered List
1. List Item
2. Longer List Item
    1. Nested OL Item
    2. Another Nested Item
3. List Item

#### Accessing Data

```
{% raw %}<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/image_name.jpg" alt="" style="width:300px;"/>{% endraw %}
```

#### Conclusion
The main takeaways I want the reader to have are: 1.) using Python is a process of constant learning and 2.) NumPy is a great starting point for any new coder. It's an important basic library to learn that will provide a foundation for future, more complex libries 

My challenge to you, the reader: Go practice moving around a dataset and learn one new command for data manupilation. Be an active learner!
